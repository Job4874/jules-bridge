# Jules Bridge — General Memory

This file is maintained by the retrospective module.
Each session that runs `POST /retrospective/analyze` will append learnings here.

> **Principle (Nick Ni)**: "Every failure becomes data for the next run."

## How to use this file

Read this at the start of a Jules Bridge coding session to understand what
has gone wrong before and what to avoid.

## Initial Notes (Bootstrapped)

- Jules Bridge is a thin HTTP routing layer — all business logic lives in `modules/`
- Never add business logic to `bridge.py` — route handlers do validate → call module → return JSON only
- The 5 core modules: `fs_service`, `shell_executor`, `ui_automation`, `inbox_service`, `oracle_session`
- Phase 2 added: `reasoning_module` (HRM H/L/ACT pattern)
- Phase 3 added: `retrospective_module` (this memory system)
- Tests live in `tests/` — run with `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- Record test evidence after every test run: `POST /retrospective/record_evidence`
